The basic goal of this analysis is to explore the **NOAA Storm Database** and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. In this analysis we want to find out, accross the US, which types of events (as indicated in the `EVTYPE` variable) are most harmful with respect to population health and which types of events have the greatest economic consequences. The Event Type variable was cleaned and the variables regarding property and crop damages were cleaned as well and aggregated in a single variable economiccost. Injuries and Fatalities were aggregated as well in a single variable healthcost. The analysis found that Tornadoes and heavy winds are most harmful to population health and Hurricanes as well as tornados have the greatest economic consequences.
