I have a passion for dissecting datasets and doing detective work to find the hidden stories in data and produce insights through creative visualizations.

Currently, I'm helping a non-profit organization reduce costs, improve decision-making and gain insights from their data to improve management.

As a physicist with a strong background in programming and implementing mathematical models that uses data analysis to identify and solve meaningful problems. 

In my career as a physicist my research focused on how individual-level interactions shape systemic-level, emergent phenomena. These phenomena ranged from the global spread of diseases to the propagation of information and behavioral traits among networks of financial traders.

Some of my previous work include forecasting the [swine-flu epidemic](http://rocs.northwestern.edu/projects/swine_flu) in real-time. It got picked by the [New York Times](http://goo.gl/jwVDA8)!

More recently, I've been sharpening my data science skills by: 

- Participating in [Kaggle Competitions](http://www.kaggle.com/users/41475/alekoki),
- Analyzing the impact of severe [weather events](http://rpubs.com/alemorale/severeweather) in the US, 
- Automatic classification of accelerometer data into physical activities
- Developing a [text prediction](http://alemorales.shinyapps.io/nextWord) app using NLP and machine learning.

Through my academic carrer I've been lucky enough to live in different countries. I've lived in Israel, Germany and finally the US. Along the way I learned their languages. I speak Spanish, English, German and long time ago I knew Hebrew --good enough to attend quantum physics lectures!
