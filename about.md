As a physicist with a strong background in programming and devising mathematical models, I like to use data analysis to identify and solve meaningful problems. 

In my career as a physicist my research focused on how individual-level interactions shape systemic-level, emergent phenomena. These phenomena ranged from the global spread of diseases to the propagation of information and behavioral traits among networks of financial traders.

Some of my previous work include forecasting the [swine-flu epidemic](http://rocs.northwestern.edu/projects/swine_flu) in real-time. It got picked by the [New York Times](http://goo.gl/jwVDA8)!

More recently, I've been sharpening my data science skills by: 

- Participating in [Kaggle Competitions](http://www.kaggle.com/users/41475/alekoki),
- Analyze the impact of severe [weather events](http://rpubs.com/alemorale/severeweather), 
- Automatically classify activities of accelerometer data and
- Develop a text prediction [app](http://alemorales.shinyapps.io/nextWord).


As of now, I help non-profit organization gain insights from their data and help them improve their operations. 


I really have a passion for dissecting datasets doing detective work to find that story the data tells through creative data visualizations.

Through my academic carrer I was lucky enough to live in different countries, like Israel, Germany and finally the US. I not only learned amazing skills but along the way picked languages. I speak German and Spanish, long time ago I knew Hebrew, good enough to attend a quantum physics class!
