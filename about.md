As a trained physicist with broad academic experience, I seek to apply my expertise in data analysis towards identifying and solving meaningful problems. My background in data-driven research is balanced by my ability to communicate with professionals from diverse backgrounds and a desire to apply data science to real-world issues.

I use methods from dynamical systems theory, network theory, statistical mechanics, and stochastic processes to develop quantitative models and theories that advance our understanding of these intricately related phenomena. I have modeled networks using a combination of analytical techniques, community-detecting algorithms, optimization and numerical methods, and large-scale computer simulations.
