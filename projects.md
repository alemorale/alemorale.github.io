### [nextWord - a word predictor webapp](http://alemorales.shinyapps.io/nextWord)
A web app I created that leverages machine learning and NLP methods to predict the next word bases on user input. It uses an n-gram language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing.

Currently, the app can predict words in English, Spanish and German.
